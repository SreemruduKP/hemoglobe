### Project Description
1. Donor and Acceptor Registration: Easy sign-up for donors and acceptors with their details and blood type.
2. Blood Type Matching: Instant blood compatibility check between donors and recipients.
3. Emergency Request: Instant alerts to nearby donors for urgent blood requirements.
4. Donor Rewarding System: Points or badges for frequent donors to gamify the experience.
5. Donation History: Automatic update of donation history data.
6. Request Alerts: Alerts when specific acceptors request you for blood.
7. Health Tips Section: Useful tips and info for donors on staying healthy.

### The Problem statement
Finding and connecting compatible blood donors with recipients is often a time-sensitive, inefficient, and cumbersome process, especially during emergencies. Traditional blood donation systems lack real-time connectivity, transparency, and engagement, leading to delays and a shortage of available blood. This inefficiency impacts lives, particularly in urgent cases where timely blood transfusions are critical.

### The Solution
We‚Äôre solving the problem with HemoGlobe, a platform that connects blood donors and recipients seamlessly. It matches compatible donors instantly, sends emergency alerts to nearby heroes, and keeps donors engaged with rewards, reminders, and real-time blood shortage updates. With HemoGlobe, saving lives is fast, easy, and even fun!
